Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

80%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I have scheduled to watch lecture videos every Tuesday and Friday from 3 PM to 5 PM at my home. This is a quiet time where I can fully focus on the material without interruptions.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I have been consistent with completing weekly readings and attending tutorials on time. Additionally, I regularly participate in discussions and make detailed notes during lectures.I will keep up with this regular routine as it’s helping me stay on track.
## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

One thing I need to stop is procrastinating on starting assignments. I often wait until the last minute to begin, which increases stress. Moving forward, I plan to set smaller deadlines for parts of each assignment to avoid rushing at the end. 

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I've observed that I frequently get right into practicals without carefully reading the guidelines. Occasionally, this results in errors that could have been prevented. I also need to spend more time thoroughly debugging code rather than scurrying online for answers. Before beginning any practical exercises, I will try to prepare my approach and work on debugging more methodically.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

For practicals, I’ve been completing most tasks within the allotted time and making sure my code is well-commented and organized. I’ve also been good at asking for help when needed, either from tutors or peers, which has helped clarify concepts faster. I will continue collaborating and keeping my code structure clean and readable.
