# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy varied. In the beginning, I often underestimated the time required due to unexpected complexity. Over time, I got better at anticipating challenges and my estimates improved.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

My estimate accuracy improved significantly as I became more familiar with the types of tasks involved. I learned to allocate more time for debugging and researching issues that were more complex than they initially seemed.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned the importance of accounting for both known and unknown factors in estimates. Estimating accurately requires understanding the nature of the tasks and leaving room for error, which comes with experience and reflection on past mistakes.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned that my code could be improved in ways I hadn't thought about. Reviews highlighted areas for optimization, pointed out style inconsistencies, and helped me understand how to write more maintainable code.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

By reviewing others' code, I learned different problem-solving approaches and techniques. It also made me more critical of my own code because I realized the importance of writing clear, efficient, and well-documented code for others to understand.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would include more practice exercises focused on debugging and testing, as they are crucial skills often overlooked. Additionally, I would provide a clearer breakdown of practical requirements to help students manage their time better.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I was able to apply new concepts consistently and integrate feedback from code reviews. I also made sure to follow best practices in code structure and documentation, which made my code easy to read and understand.
